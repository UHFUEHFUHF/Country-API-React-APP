🌍 Country Info App
This is a simple React.js project where you can search for any country and get full details about it using the REST Countries API.

The project shows things like:

Flag of the country

Population

Capital city

Region and Subregion

Currencies, Languages

Timezones, Continents

Google Maps location

Neighboring countries

And much more!

🚀 How the project works
You select or search for a country.

The app fetches complete information from the REST Countries API based on the country name.

All the information is displayed in a clean, readable way along with the country's flag on the left side.
